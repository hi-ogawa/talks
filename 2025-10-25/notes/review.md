- [x] Replaced Summary with Key Takeaways (commit cc38453)
- [x] Changed em-dashes to colons in Key Takeaways
- [x] Fixed grammar errors at slides.md:131-133
  - "The talk will talk about" → "The talk covers"
  - "unique feature is" → "unique features are"
- [x] Updated script.md to match current slide structure
  - Merged timeline.md timing into script.md
  - Removed timeline.md

## Remaining Items

### TODOs in File
- **Location:** slides.md:24
  - `<!-- TODO: move "about me" after intro? -->`
  - **Status:** Current placement (slide 2) is fine and standard. Can move after "What is Vitest?" slides if you want more immediate hook.

- **Location:** slides.md:791
  - `<!-- TODO: animation to highlight difference -->`
  - **Context:** SSR / Client environment slide comparing Vue transforms
  - **Status:** Consider adding click animations to highlight differences between client and SSR transforms

## Optional Improvements

### Slide Pacing
- ~30 visible slides for 30-min talk = ~1 min/slide average
- Technical depth slides (module runner, mocking, etc.) may need more time
- Ensure intro/overview slides move quickly to compensate

### Monorepo Packages Diagram
- **Location:** Slide after Overview (line ~229)
- **Suggestion:** Add speaker note about what to highlight when showing the diagram
- Current comment just references npmgraph.js.org source

## Content Review Summary
- Solid technical depth and flow
- Good progression from lifecycle → orchestration → Vite integration → packages
- Examples are accurate and match actual test files
- Key Takeaways provide memorable architectural insights
