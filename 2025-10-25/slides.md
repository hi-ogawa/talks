#   ## Inside Vitest: Test Framework Architecture Deep Dive
  
#   This talk explores what makes Vitest architecturally unique, including how it leverages Vite's broad framework ecosystem and plugin capabilities, its runtime agnostic architecture that enables running the same tests across Node.js, browsers, and edge environments, and the implementation of core testing features like mocking, coverage, and parallel execution systems.

# What is Vitest?

```tsx {3,6,9,14-15,19-20}
// packages/vite/src/node/__tests__/scan.spec.ts
import path from 'node:path'
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { commentRE, } from '../optimizer/scan'

describe('optimizer-scan:script-test', () => {
  /*...*/

  test('component return value test', () => {
    scriptRE.lastIndex = 0
    const [, tsOpenTag, tsContent] = scriptRE.exec(
      `<script lang="ts">${scriptContent}</script>`,
    )!
    expect(tsOpenTag).toEqual('<script lang="ts">')
    expect(tsContent).toEqual(scriptContent)

    scriptRE.lastIndex = 0
    const [, openTag, content] = scriptRE.exec(...)!
    expect(openTag).toEqual('<script>')
    expect(content).toEqual(scriptContent)
```

<!-- 
This is one unit test case from Vite.
https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/packages/vite/src/node/__tests__/scan.spec.ts.

You see hopefully familar Test API like `describe`, `test`, `expect`.
Output on the right is what you see when you run `vitest` command.

# What is Vitest?

<!-- TODO: code on the right -->
<!-- TODO: more icon -->

- Jest-compatible API
  - `describe`, `test`, `expect`, ...
- ESM and TypeScript support out of the box
  - Vite builtin features
- Extensible via Vite plugin ecosystem
  - Vue, React, Svelte, ...
- Runtime agnostics
  - Node.js, Browser, Cloudflare Workers

```ts 
// [add.test.ts]
import { test, expect, describe } from "vitest"
import { add } from "./add"

describe(add, () => {
  test('one plus two', () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3)
  })
})
```

<!-- TODO: morph the code into jsdom vue-->

<!-- ```ts 
// [hello.test.ts]
import { test, expect, describe } from "vitest"
import Hello from './Hello.vue'

test('Hello component', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})
``` -->

<!-- TODO: morph the code into browser mode vue -->

<!-- ```ts 
// [hello.test.ts]
import { test, expect, describe } from "vitest"
import Hello from './Hello.vue'

test('Hello component', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})
``` -->

<!-- 

I would say Vitest is useful its own even if not on Vite projects.
But, obviously for Vite projects, 

The talk will about general test framework feature implementation.
Vite and Vitest unique feature is expalined as it comes up.

 -->

---

# Talk Overview

<!-- 
TODO: Reverse? package -> features? e.g.
@vitest/expect, @vitest/snapshot -> assertion API (`expect`, `toEqual`, `toMatchSnapshot`)
@vitest/runner -> managing test case hierarchy and execution (`describe`, `test`, timeout, retry)
vitest, tinypool, birpc -> test orchestration, reporter, etc.
vite, vite/module-runner -> Javascript runtime with custom transform
@vitest/mocker -> Module mocking `vi.mock("", () => {})`
@vitest/coverage-v8, @vitest/coverage-istanbul -> coverage collection and reporting

TODO: code, server-client, architecture e.g.

-->


- Lifecycle of running tests
- Explain bits and pieces of Vitest as Test framework
  - Assertion libraries: [`@vitest/expect`](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/packages/expect), [`@vitest/snapshot`](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/packages/snapshot)
    <!-- TODO: reference on license verbatim from Jasmine, Jest -->
  - Test runner: `@vitest/runner`
  - Javscript Runtime: `vite-node`, `vite/module-runner`
  - Test orchestraion: `vitest`, `vite`, `tinypool`, `birpc`

<!--
We start from reviewing the basic steps and lifecycle of running tests.
We then explain and dig deeper about each step and each component.
Along the way, we see how Vitest utilizes Vite as a foundation of certain components.
And also we'll see large parts of Vitest are not actually tied to Vite, but general test framework implementation.
Even if you are not Vitest users but Jest, Playwright, etc. users, I believe you'll be benefit
from understanding the overall test framework internals.

# Lifecycle of running tests

<!-- TODO: clicks, highlight -->
<!-- TODO: map each step with reporter duration -->
<!-- TODO: map each step with incremental reporter output -->
<!-- TODO: this is kinda "visible" part. it doesn't include worker etc. -->

- Select test files to run (CLI arguments, Configuration, etc.)
  - `vitest src/add.test.ts src/dir/ --project xxx`
  - `defineConfig({ test: { dir: ..., include: ..., exclude: ... }, projects: [...] })`
- Run test files to collect Test cases
  - `test("foo", () => { ... })` 
    <!-- (TODO: highlight which part is executed. it's not "...") -->
  - `describe("foo", () => { ... })`
  <!-- At this point, we obtain the tree / forest structure of all suites, hooks, test cases. cf. verbose reporter tree output -->
  <!-- Some tests maybe be skipped via `test.only`,`test.skip`, `vitest -t`, so we resolve skip states here. -->
- Running Test cases
  - `test("foo", () => { ... })` ("..." is the part actually executed)
  - verify assertions e.g. `expect(...).toEqual(...)`
- Reporting (incremental and final summary)

# Test framework features

TODO: back to "Talk Overview" slide? what to elaborate here?
TODO: Should we change the order "top to bottom"? (i.e. from orchestration to individual assertions)

- Assertions
- Test runner
- Tets runtime
- Test orchestration

---

# `@vites/expect`: `expect`

TODO: sample code

- Based on [`chai`](https://www.chaijs.com/) extension system

```ts
import { expect } from 'vitest'
```

---

# `@vites/expect`: `toEqual`

TODO: sample

- Port of Jest `toEqual` implementation
- Error diff xamp

---

# `@vites/snapshot`: `toMatchSnapshot`, `toMatchInlineSnapshot`

TODO: sample

---

# Assertion Features

<v-clicks>

## Pure Assertion
- Expect API compatible with Jest/Chai
- Rich matchers and custom matchers

```ts
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'

test('assertion examples', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4)
  expect({ name: 'Vitest' }).toEqual({ name: 'Vitest' })
  expect([1, 2, 3]).toContain(2)
  expect(() => { throw new Error('fail') }).toThrow('fail')
})
```

      forks: { singleFork: false }
    }
  }
})
```
