## Phase 1: Foundation (DO FIRST) ⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: Critical | **Effort**: Medium-High | **Time**: 4-6 hours

### 1.1 Structure Decisions (Lines 141-157, 258-259)
**Why Critical**: Affects entire presentation flow
```
Action Items:
├── Decide: Bottom-up (packages→features) vs Top-down (features→packages)
├── Recommendation: Bottom-up is more concrete
├── Remove/merge "Test framework features" redundant section
└── Update Talk Overview slide accordingly
```

### 1.2 Core Missing Content
**Why Critical**: Can't present without these sections
```
Priority Content:
├── Line 585: Watch Mode ⭐⭐⭐ (Key Vitest differentiator)
│   └── Content: File watcher, HMR mechanism, module graph
├── Line 563: Client-Server Communication ⭐⭐⭐
│   └── Content: birpc, IPC, MessageChannel, WebSocket, BroadcastChannel
├── Line 579: Coverage ⭐⭐
│   └── Content: V8 vs Istanbul, collection, reporting
├── Line 573: Reporter API ⭐⭐
│   └── Content: Built-in reporters, custom reporter API
└── Line 555: Test Scheduling ⭐⭐
    └── Content: Isolation, parallelization, tinypool
```

### 1.3 Architecture Diagram (Line 383)
**Why Critical**: Central to understanding Vitest
```
Diagram Should Show:
├── Server Side: ViteDevServer, Pool Orchestration, Reporter
├── Client Side: Browser, Child Process, Worker Threads
├── Communication: HTTP requests, Module Runner, RPC
└── Data Flow: Test files → Transform → Execute → Report
```

**Phase 1 Deliverable**: Presentation has coherent structure and all core content

---

## Phase 2: Visual Clarity (DO SECOND) ⭐⭐
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Time**: 3-4 hours

### 2.1 Lifecycle Enhancements (Lines 232-242)
**Why Important**: Makes abstract concepts concrete
```
Enhancements:
├── Add click animations for step-by-step reveal
├── Map each step to reporter duration output
├── Show incremental reporter output for each phase
├── Highlight specific code execution portions
└── Visual connection between code and output
```

### 2.2 Visual Elements (Lines 16-17, 78-79, 270)
**Why Important**: Professional appearance, better engagement
```
Visual Assets:
├── About Me: GitHub avatar, VoidZero logo
├── What is Vitest: Icons, improved layout
├── Expect API: Jest icon, Chai icon
└── Code snippets: Better syntax highlighting, side-by-side layout
```

### 2.3 Layout Improvements (Lines 193-194, 330-331)
**Why Important**: Easier to follow
```
Layout Updates:
├── Lifecycle section: CLI, config, test, output in clear progression
├── Test collection: Improve clicks and layout
└── Consider reordering sections for better flow
```

**Phase 2 Deliverable**: Visually polished presentation with clear progression

---

## Phase 3: Completion (DO THIRD) ⭐
**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low-Medium | **Time**: 2-3 hours

### 3.1 Remaining Sections
```
Complete:
├── Line 591: Summary slide (tie back to lifecycle overview)
└── Line 597: Thank You slide (sponsors, contributors, links)
```

### 3.2 Supporting Examples
```
Add:
├── Line 324: Snapshot inline/file code example
└── Line 451: Before/after module runner transform (if adds value)
```

### 3.3 Minor Enhancements
```
Polish:
├── Line 242: Clarify execution highlighting in test code
└── Ensure all code examples are consistent and clear
```

**Phase 3 Deliverable**: Complete, professional presentation ready to present

---

## Phase 4: Optional Enhancements ⚡
**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Medium-High | **Time**: 3-4 hours

### 4.1 Deep Dive Content (If Audience is Advanced)
```
Advanced Topics:
├── Lines 294-295: Chai extension system, pretty-format internals
├── Lines 483, 491: Module mocking runtime, visualization
└── Line 165, 276: License attributions (or put in speaker notes)
```

### 4.2 Progressive Examples (If Time Permits)
```
Code Morphing:
├── Line 102: Basic test → jsdom Vue test
└── Line 114: jsdom Vue → browser mode Vue test
```

### 4.3 Additional Context
```
Optional:
├── Line 396: Browser mode explanation ordering
├── Line 441: Elaborate on module runner details
└── Line 62: ASCII art for terminal output
```

**Phase 4 Deliverable**: Enhanced presentation with extra depth

---

## Items to SKIP ❌

```
Skip These:
├── Line 183: "Why Testing?" section (obvious to audience)
├── Line 432: Commented vite/module-runner slide
├── Line 470: Vite SPA analogy (unnecessary)
└── Line 553: Browser mode scheduling (too complex, author agrees)
```

---

## Recommended Workflow

### Week Before Presentation
```
Day 1-2: Phase 1 (Foundation)
  ├── Morning: Structure decisions
  ├── Afternoon: Write missing content
  └── Evening: Architecture diagram

Day 3: Phase 2 (Visual Clarity)
  ├── Morning: Lifecycle enhancements
  ├── Afternoon: Visual elements
  └── Evening: Layout improvements

Day 4: Phase 3 (Completion)
  ├── Morning: Remaining sections
  ├── Afternoon: Supporting examples
  └── Evening: Review and test

Day 5: Buffer & Practice
  ├── Morning: Phase 4 if time permits
  ├── Afternoon: Practice presentation
  └── Evening: Final polish
```

### Last Minute (Only 1-2 Days Available)
```
Critical Path:
Hour 1-2:   Decide structure, update Talk Overview
Hour 3-5:   Write Watch Mode, Client-Server sections
Hour 6-7:   Create architecture diagram
Hour 8-9:   Add lifecycle highlights
Hour 10:    Summary, Thank You slides
Hour 11-12: Practice and final review
```

- Focus exclusively on Phase 1 items
- Use speaker notes instead of slides for Phase 4 content
- Practice with incomplete slides to identify critical gaps

### Risk: Too Much Content
**Mitigation**:
- Time each section during practice
- Prepare "skip" slides for time overrun
- Mark optional deep-dives clearly

### Risk: Technical Complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple examples, add complexity gradually
- Use analogies for complex concepts
- Prepare FAQs for Q&A session
