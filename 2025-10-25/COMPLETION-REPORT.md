## Strategic Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (4-6 hours) - MUST DO
âœ… Decide talk structure (bottom-up vs top-down)  
âœ… Write missing core content sections (Watch Mode, Client-Server, Coverage, etc.)  
âœ… Create architecture diagram  
âœ… Add lifecycle visual enhancements  

**Impact**: Transforms presentation from incomplete to presentable

### Phase 2: Visual Clarity (3-4 hours) - SHOULD DO
âœ… Add visual elements (avatars, logos, icons)  
âœ… Improve layouts and progressive reveals  
âœ… Enhance code examples with highlighting  

**Impact**: Elevates from presentable to professional

### Phase 3: Completion (2-3 hours) - GOOD TO DO
âœ… Complete remaining sections (Summary, Thank You)  
âœ… Add supporting examples  
âœ… Polish minor details  

**Impact**: Achieves complete, polished presentation

### Phase 4: Optional Enhancements (3-4 hours) - IF TIME PERMITS
âœ… Deep dive technical content  
âœ… Progressive code examples  
âœ… Additional context and attribution  

**Impact**: Goes from excellent to exceptional

   â†“
9. Ship it! ðŸš€
```

### Team Collaboration
If working with a team:
- Share README.md for overview
- Assign phases from EXECUTION-PLAN.md
- Use TODO-CHECKLIST.md for coordination
- Reference TODO-ORGANIZATION.md for details
- Review together daily

## Key Decisions Required

### Structural Decisions
- [ ] **Talk Structure**: Bottom-up (packagesâ†’features) OR Top-down (featuresâ†’packages)
  - Recommendation: Bottom-up for technical audience
  
- [ ] **Section Removal**: Remove "Test framework features" redundant section
  - Recommendation: Merge with Talk Overview or remove

- [ ] **Section Reordering**: Move test collection after test runner?
  - Recommendation: Yes, improves logical flow

### Content Depth Decisions
- [ ] Include deep dive on module mocking runtime?
  - Recommendation: Main talk = overview, Q&A = deep dive
  
- [ ] Include Chai extension system details?
  - Recommendation: Brief mention, full details in speaker notes
  
- [ ] Include browser mode scheduling complexity?
  - Recommendation: Skip (even author suggests this)

### Visual Enhancement Decisions
- [ ] ASCII art for terminal output?
  - Recommendation: Test readability, use if clear
  
- [ ] Code morphing animations (basic â†’ Vue)?
  - Recommendation: Nice to have if time permits

---

## Files to Skip/Remove

### Confirmed Skip Items
1. **Line 183**: "Why Testing?" section
   - Reason: Obvious to technical audience
   
2. **Line 432**: Commented vite/module-runner slide
   - Reason: Already covered elsewhere
   
3. **Line 470**: Vite SPA analogy
   - Reason: Adds confusion, not clarity
   
4. **Line 553**: Browser mode test scheduling details
   - Reason: Too complex, author recommends skipping

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Running Out of Time
**Mitigation**:
- Focus exclusively on Phase 1
- Move Phase 3-4 content to speaker notes
- Practice with incomplete slides early

### Risk: Too Much Content
**Mitigation**:
- Time each section during practice
- Prepare optional "skip" slides
- Mark deep-dives for Q&A

### Risk: Technical Complexity Overwhelming
**Mitigation**:
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Use analogies for hard concepts
- Prepare simplified backup explanations

### Risk: Last-Minute Changes
**Mitigation**:
- Freeze slides 24 hours before
- Only fix critical bugs
- Focus on delivery practice
