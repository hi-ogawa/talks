## Ryan Carniato
**"Reactivity: There and Back Again" (2022)**
- YouTube: ViteConf 2022
- Perfect for you because it covers how different frameworks handle reactivity internally
- Excellent progression from simple to complex concepts
- Great use of visual diagrams to explain data flow

## Jake Archibald  
**"In The Loop" (2018)**
- YouTube: JSConf.Asia 2018
- Masterclass in explaining complex browser internals (event loop)
- Amazing custom visualizations and live demos
- Shows how to make dense technical content entertaining
- Perfect pacing and humor integration

## Rich Harris
**"Rethinking Reactivity" (2019)**
- YouTube: You Gotta Love Frontend Conference
- The talk that introduced Svelte 3's compiler approach
- Excellent at building narrative ("why we need to rethink")

## Bonus: Specifically for Test Framework Architecture
**"Jest Architecture" by Christoph Nakazawa (2018)**
- YouTube: ReactiveConf 2018  
- Former Jest maintainer explaining internals
- Directly relevant to your topic
- Good example of explaining worker architecture and parallelization

Each of these talks excels at:
- Making complex internals accessible
- Using visuals effectively
- Maintaining energy throughout
- Building from fundamentals to advanced concepts

Watch for their techniques in:
- Introducing complexity gradually
- Using analogies
- Handling transitions
- Keeping audience engaged during deep technical sections
